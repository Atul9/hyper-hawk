Hawk Authentication for Rust
============================

This is a Rust implementation of (Hawk)[https://github.com/hueniverse/hawk].

## TODO

### For release

* Bewit support
* Add a server example in src/lib.rs

### Later

* Support references in Header (but this is not compatible with Hyper<0.11)
