Hawk Authentication for Rust
============================

This is a Rust implementation of [Hawk](https://github.com/hueniverse/hawk).

It consists of two crates:

 * [`hawk`](https://docs.rs/hawk/) - core protocol implementation
 * `hyper-hawk` (not released yet) - specialization for Hyper

## Project Status

This project is mostly a way for me (@djmitche) to learn Rust.
As such, it is not feature-complete and I do not dedicate a substantial amount of time to it.
If you are using Hawk with Rust in a production setting, please consider becoming a maintainer of these crates.
